# Halls in Ripley's

This document lays out the various halls in Ripley's. Players should discover their contents over time rather than being given a full list. If they ask say say [Nathan](./npcs/nathan_ripley.md) didn't take the time to show them around during training and just asked them to discover the halls on their own.
