# Overview of Ripley's

This document lays out the high level adventure. You can safely share the hook with players. But the plot should be kept secret.

## Hook

When Ripley's was built is was contravertial. The otherwise modest town didn't attract many tourists until then and residents enjoys a slower paced life. Now the main steet in town has a fudge shop, and several shops sell junky souvineers, on the corner there's a pizza place for parents who "just can't be bothered" after the long car ride. An alpine coaster winds it's way down the hillside just out of town. In the summer it bustles with tourists, in the winter th town sits abandoned.

As the tourist season ends and the weather gets colder the students that worked the summer at Ripley's return to school. In their stead you are hired to secure, clean, advertise, and curate the museam's....eclectic artifacts.


## Plot

The players will each assume the role(s) of Janitor, Security Gaurd, Curator, and Social Media Content Executive. They Frequently or almost exclusively work nights to avoid tourists or "guests" as corporate wants you to call them. They are all told they are being hired because the seasonal staff was heading back to school, however this is not the whole truth. As the players later discover the previous employees were either fired, unexpectedly quit, or simply stopped showing up to work recently (GM's choice which makes the most sense based on context)

One of the many exibits at Ripleys is the slightly problematic: "Indian Religion" hall. Which shows off a colleciton of artifacts from native American cultures. Unfortunately the curator is aware that this exshibit is inaccurate at best and offensive to some. If they raise the issue to management they are ignored.

The hall is filled with special artifacts which the site manager [Nathan Ripley](./npcs/nathan_ripley.md) is attempting to use to alter the past in order to become even more wealthy. The artifacts are:
 - A peace pipe that allows the smoker to see through the eyes of an ancestor
 -
